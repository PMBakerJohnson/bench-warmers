# BenchWarmers

This is the front end of a project put together by several Onshore employees that are currently not working on any projects to keep us busy and give us hands on experience with specific technologies. Our current vision is of a text based RPG with some idle mechanics.

## Roadmap
I got nothing. We're flying by the seat of our pants. As of writing this (8/21), we're hoping to have a big planning meeting tomorrow to communicate our long term goals for this project, but it's also looking very likely that we might be pushed into doing something different.

## Team Members
Our current team is comprised of (going off of Github usernames)
- carletonDev
- lily-ayers
- XavierRichardson
- and yours truly, PMBakerJohnson.
